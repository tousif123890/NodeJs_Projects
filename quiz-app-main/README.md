# Quiz App

I created a React quiz app on which you can enter you name and start the game. Once the game is started you have to answer within 30 sec. The timer will start automatically and count down 30. If you did not answer then you loose. If you answer wrongly then you loose. But if you answer correctly then it will proceed to next question and the timer will also reset to 30 secs again. There will be a money tree where you see the amount you have won since it will be highlighted.
